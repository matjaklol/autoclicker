# matClicker Autoclicker

This is a basic autoclicker/keyboard utility that allows for precise autoclick timings, specific positional clicks, double clicks, etc.

It also includes an 'anti-afk' feature (anti-away-from-keyboard) for certain programs that might monitor for when you're away from your computer. This has some customizability (such as using keyboard inputs, mouse inputs, or just one of the two), timing adjustment, etc.

This was built using JavaFX and SceneBuilder, with some basic logic using [jnativehook](https://github.com/kwhat/jnativehook) for the keybindings.
## Installation

The basic installation can be done in two ways. There's a prebundled executable with all libraries, so simply run the executable as administrator and bingo.

The advanced setup involves the packaged .jar file included in the release folder. This should run so long as your jdk compliance is 22 or above with no issues.
